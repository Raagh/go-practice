# 2.1

lots of inserts, 1 read-> linked list
lots of reads, little inserts or a known set of elements -> array

# 2.2

I would use a linked list to implement the order queue from the restaurant

# 2.3

array (sorted)

# 2.4

there is a chance you dont have enough memory available
you need to shift elements to put the name sorted in the array

# 2.5

searching -> slower than array and faster than linked list
inserting -> faster than array and same than linked list
